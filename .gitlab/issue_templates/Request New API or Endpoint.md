## Implementation Guide

The code in `client-go` has a strong pattern that is repeatable when adding support for new APIs.

- Read the instructions in `CONTRIBUTING.md` to get your local development environment set up.
- Follow the instructions in `AddingAPISupport.md`.
  - This file includes instructions for adding all endpoints of an API.
  - It also describes how to write functions for each type of endpoint, so can be used for adding new endpoint support as well.
